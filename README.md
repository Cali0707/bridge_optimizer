# bridge_optimizer
This is a python script to find the optimal dimensions for a simply suported bridge with a length of 950mm,
and two point loads each 280mm from one end, as outlined in the final CIV102 project for 2020. The design
is for a box girder with double-thickness flanges on both top and bottom.
